# L-BOC
L-BOC (Let's Bring Objects to C) is a project I am developing to improve my C programming skill with respect to a topic I always neglected: function pointers.
To improve in this area I set myself a big objective: make C object oriented! I will try to bring objects to this "low-level" programming language, and make them usable (as close as possible to standart Object-Oriented languages).
